Revision: 

EXT. EMERGENCY CLINIC - DAY
# Long lens but far back, profile on the car, it’s effectively a wide shot but as mentioned it’s on a long lens. We catch Garrett moving from the car into the clinic.
GARRETT (late 40s, black, built like a wrestler) parks his car frantically. He tumbles out of the car and into the clinic.
INT. EMERGENCY CLINIC
Garrett goes immediately to the front desk, behind which is a RECEPTIONIST (white, mid 30s). 

GARRETT
Hi, Moriah Covington’s room?

RECEPTIONIST
Okay, are you family?

GARRETT
I’m her dad.

RECEPTIONIST
ID?

Garrett fumbles around for his ID and hands it to her. She looks it over, and gives him the side-eye.

GARRETT
Yeah it’s a different last name.

RECEPTIONIST
I’m gonna need you to be on her list.

GARRETT
Her list? What?

JASMINE (O.S.)
Garrett!

JASMINE (late 40s, black, dressed elegantly--and effortlessly) appears, from the hallway leading to the clinic rooms. She speed-walks over and hugs Garrett.

GARRETT
Is she okay?

JASMINE
She’s fine.
(to Receptionist)
He can come back.

RECEPTIONIST
(holding out clipboard)
He’s gotta fill out this form.

JASMINE
(grabs clipboard)
Sure.

RECEPTIONIST
He needs to do it.

Jasmine puts her hands up apologetically; Garrett grudgingly takes the clipboard. He and Jasmine walk slightly away.

GARRETT
Wow, fuck this place.

JASMINE
Just fill it out.

INT. CLINIC ROOM - DAY
With Jasmine in tow, Garrett barrels into the room--MORIAH is in here; she’s 17, black, has a bandage on her arm, and she’s sitting on the exam room table impatiently twiddling her thumbs.

GARRETT
(frantic)
Baby, you okay?

MORIAH
Yup.

GARRETT
Does it hurt?

MORIAH
Not really.

Garrett tries to hug her--

MORIAH
Ow--don’t do that, that hurts.

GARRETT
(calling out)
Hey excuse me! Can you get her some pain medication?

MORIAH
No I don’t need pain meds, just don’t push my arm like that.

GARRETT
What happened?

MORIAH
Whaddyou mena? Oh--my arm. Uh, no I just fell. Nothing dramatic.

GARRETT
Baby, you broke you arm, you wanna tell me what really happened?

MORIAH
No it’s not broken. It’s a hairline fracture, it’s a different thing, it’s just like a little split down the outside of the bone. Doctor here explained it, he’s really good.

GARRETT
Someone hit you?

MORIAH
No--dad, this was soccer practice, is where it happened.

GARRETT
Which no-one was gonna tell me about?

A NURSE appears.

GARRETT
Hi, can you get her some pain medication?

MORIAH
Nope, I don’t need that. I got ibuprofen, please go away. Sorry.

GARRETT
Why isn’t her arm in a cast?

MORIAH
‘Cause they don’t do that for hairline fractures--Dad I told you, it’s not broken. You know we got all this figured out.

GARRETT
Where’s the other girl?

MORIAH
What other girl?

GARRETT
She in the hospital? The other one who got hurt.

JASMINE
Oh yeah, he’s in the hospital.

GARRETT
He? It’s a he?

MORIAH
Yeah but he did *not* need to go to the hospital, he’s fine.

GARRETT
No no I thought you and some other girl got hit by a boy.

MORIAH
Nobody hit anybody, we were practicing with the boys ‘cause there’s not enough girls on the team yet, and this very stupid kid got right in my elbow space. Just caught my elbow, dumbass.

GARRETT
Heyyy. Excuse you.

MORIAH
I’m just saying. I didn’t do anything.

GARRETT
Okay you’re gonna go apologize.

MORIAH
Absolutely not. And he doesn’t even wanna see me, he just got messed up by a girl, he’s probably embarassed.

GARRETT
You put someone in the hospital, you apologize. We’re going there right now.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
Moriah, Jasmine and Garrett all stare back at CAMERON (17, white), in his hospital bed, with his face all bandaged and stitched up. His PARENTS are looking mean, with arms crossed.

MORIAH
Sorry. Um... didn’t mean to mess up your face like that. Sorry. ... But you look really cool with a black eye!

JASMINE
Okay--we’re just gonna--
(to Cameron)
Cameron, I hope you have a swift recovery, we’re so sorry.
(to Parents)
Call me if you need anything.

Jasmine, Garrett and Moriah all leave in a hurry.

INT. JASMINE’S CAR (MOVING) - DAY
Jasmine drives; Moriah stares out the passengers seat window, exhausted.

INT. JASMINE’S HOUSE - DAY
The house has magnificent natural light, it’s a victorian style home, dark hardwood floors, tasteful decor, not a single piece of furniture looks out of place. The front door opens and Moriah and Jasmine drag themselves inside.

JASMINE
Baby I’m going back to the office in about twenty.

Moriah gives a thumbs-up over her shoulder and goes upstairs.

INT. GARRETT’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Garrett reads email on his laptop. The apartment door opens, the lights go on--we see SIMON (late 40s, black). He’s very well put together. He presents as a soft, gentle counterpart to the tightly-wound Garrett.

SIMON
Hey hey. All good?

GARRETT
Yeah.

SIMON
You’re sitting here in the dark.

Simon crosses the room, leans over and gives Garrett a kiss.

SIMON
Moriah’s okay?

GARRETT
Yeah. She’ll be fine.

SIMON
That her first broken bone?

GARRETT
It’s not a borken bone, it’s a hairline fracture. It’s different.

SIMON
Ah.

INT. OFFICE - NIGHT
Jasmine is the only one here, the office is spooky at this time of night. She’s checking a printed-out stack of papers against a spreadsheet on her laptop. Her phone rings--she looks at the caller ID skeptically. She answers it--

JASMINE
Helloooo...?

GARRETT (V.O.)
Are you in bed?

JASMINE
Currently not in bed. Why?

GARRETT (V.O.)
You going home soon?

INT. GARRETT’S APARTMENT - THAT MOMENT
Garrett is on his couch, phone pressed to his ear.

JASMINE (V.O.)
.. Is this that kind of call?

GARRETT
Maybe.

INT. OFFICE

JASMINE
I dunno, I’m tired.

GARRETT (V.O.)
Yeah but we’re old, we’re always tired.

JASMINE
(considers for a moment)
... Well don’t say I didn’t warn you--I’m heading home in, like, thirty minutes.

INT. JASMINE’S HOUSE/BEDROOM - NIGHT
Jasmine and Garrett snuggle, clothes starting to come off. It gets more hot and heavy. Then Jasmine pulls away.

GARRETT
You good?

JASMINE
Can we just--

Jasmine lays her head in Garrett’s chest.

GARRETT
Okay.

JASMINE
What? Is it too...?

GARRETT
No. It’s totally fine.

Jasmine reads his face, then lays in his chest.

JASMINE
Just running around nonstop, it gets to me.

GARRETT
That’s what I’m saying about these micronaps I been taking.

JASMINE
Mmhm. This is a micronap right here.

GARRETT
Okay.

He pats her head.

GARRETT
I can’t sleep here.

JASMINE
I know.

A knock at the door. Garrett and Jasmine make eye contact.

JASMINE
See? What’d I tell you?

Another knock--

MORIAH (V.O.)
Guys? Can I come in?

JASMINE
Yep! It’s open!

The door opens, there’s Moriah.
[[CAMERA pans left to catch moriah just as she opens the door.]]

MORIAH
Hey I’m gonna pop over to the corner store.

JASMINE
Why?

MORIAH
I’m gonna get some chips.

JASMINE
I got chips--I got groceries delivered. 

MORIAH
You didn’t get my chips. You guys want anything?

Both Jasmine and Garrett are a little amused and confounded.

GARRETT
No--we’re good.

JASMINE
Yeah, thank you.

GARRETT
Can you actually maybe not go out, at this hour?

MORIAH
It’s fine.

Moriah disappears out the door, closing it behind her.

GARRETT
Since when does she just get to leave the house whenever she wants?

JASMINE
When she’s at your house, you do what you need to, it’s my rules in my house.

GARRETT
(considers that)
... Fair enough.

INT. RESTAURANT - DAY
JAIME walks in--he’s scrawny, attractive in a sloppy way, seventeen years old. Scans the crowd in this cozy little café-like restaurant, spots Moriah, who is taking people’s orders and bussing tables. She glances at him when he walks over to her.

MORIAH
What’re you doing here?

JAIME
I just drove here.

MORIAH
From Chicago?

JAIME
Yeah.

MORIAH
Are you movin’ here?

JAIME
Maybe.

MORIAH
Does your mom know?

JAIME
No.

MORIAH
What’d your dad say?

JAIME
I told him I’m at a friend’s house.

MORIAH
(clicks tongue)
You’re so crazy.

JAIME
What time you get off work?

MORIAH
Couple hours.

JAIME
‘Cause we should hang out.

Moriah grabs plates of food from the expo window and marches them over to a table. Jaime sort of follows and lingers.

MORIAH
(to Customers)
Here you guys go.
(back to Jaime)
What’d you say?

JAIME
We should hang out.

MORIAH
Yeah... is that... I dunno if that’s a good idea.

JAIME
No, not like that. I just don’t know anybody here.

Moriah shrugs, acquiescing.

JAIME
What time you get off work?

MORIAH
Four-thirty.

JAIME
Alright. I’ll see you.

He walks out. 

EXT. RESTAURANT - DAY (LATER)
Moriah exits the restaurant, looks around, shrugs, starts walking down the sidewalk. Across the street, Jaime is sitting in his car, distracted on his phone, but notices Moriah and hurriedly gets out, crosses the street and catches up to Moriah. She turns around.

JAIME
Come on.

INT. JAIME’S CAR (MOVING) - DAY
Jaime drives, Moriah is in the passenger seat, some cool R&B music is playing.

MORIAH
When did you get this car?

JAIME
Few months ago.

MORIAH
Your mom bought it for you?

JAIME
Nope. ...
(reads Moriah’s skepticism)
No I paid for it, with my money. Ask her.

MORIAH
Now I’m just worried ‘bout how you got the money.

JAIME
I freelance. Cybersecurity.

MORIAH
Right. You just hit ‘em with a ransomware attack first, then offer to beef up their security?

JAIME
I don’t do that anymore. Turned a new leaf.

MORIAH
Sure.

They drive in silence for a minute. Then Jaime glances at Moriah.

JAIME
So you think this is wrong, or whatever, for us to hang out?

MORIAH
It’s not wrong, it’s just kinda weird now that we’ve...

JAIME
Yeah I just think we should be friends.

MORIAH
Me too. If anything. Not that we have to be anything.

Jaime nods, processing every intonation.

EXT. GRACIELA’S HOUSE - DAY
This house is very big, there’s a wonderfully manicured lawn and garden, it has a lot of character. And so do the neighboring houses. Tasteful and idyllic. Jaime’s car pulls to a stop by the curb.

MORIAH (V.O.)
Is your mom here?

JAIME
She’s on a work trip.

INT. GRACIELA’S HOUSE - DAY
Jaime and Moriah walk through the big house. There’s the fanciest version of every appliance and the nicest furniture. 

JAIME
Is your house this big?

MORIAH
No. What’s your dad’s house like?

JAIME
It’s kinda small, it’s an apartment.

MORIAH
Same with my dad’s.

JAIME
You should invite people over.

MORIAH
No, my dad freaks out if anything’s messed up like the tiniest bit.

JAIME
No, invite people here.

MORIAH
Here to your house? You wanna have a party?

JAIME
House is empty all weekend. But I don’t know anyone here, you gotta invite people.

MORIAH
This why you wanted to hang out? You wanted me to invite people to your party?

JAIME
No I literally just thought of this right now. But if you don’t wanna, that’s cool.

... Moriah pulls out her phone.

MORIAH
No promises, it’s kinda last-minute.

INT. GRACIELA’S HOUSE - NIGHT
High schoolers are everywhere, they’re drinking and smoking weed and raiding the fridge and there’s loud music playing. Jaime is the life of the party, naturally charismatic. Too charming for his own good. He’s playing DJ and chatting up everybody.

Cameron is here, he’s bandaged in the face and moving a bit stiffly, pouring himself a drink. He and Moriah see each other and lock eyes. Moriah walks over, liquid courage be her guide.

CAMERON
Sorry about your arm.

MORIAH
Thank you.

CAMERON
Probbaly hurts a lot.

MORIAH
Yeah. Does that apology count though? ‘Cause it didn’t happen in front of my parents.

CAMERON
I’ll get your parents here right now.

MORIAH
No, just make it up to me.

CAMERON
(pointing to his face)
This doesn’t make us even?

MORIAH
Nope.

There’s a flirty moment between them, all in the eyes.

INT. GRACIELA’S HOUSE/BEDROOM - NIGHT (A MINUTE LATER)
Moriah and Cameron are awkward. It’s a lot of slow, stiff movements, and uncomfortable laughing at their own awkwardness. Kissing, and slowly unbuttoning Moriah’s top, and Cameron taking off his shirt. Upon the reality of a naked boy chest in front of her, Moriah freezes.

CAMERON
You okay?

MORIAH
Yeah.

She snaps out of it, throwing herself at him confidently.

EXT. GRACIELA’S HOUSE - NIGHT (LATER)
# The camera is seeing both Jasmine / her car + the house -- it’s kind of a diagonal angle on her. Wide, like 40mm, so we can be pretty close to her while still observing surroundings.
Jasmine pulls her car to a stop and gets out--there is clearly a party happening in the house, because cars are parked and music is audible and lights are on and teenagers are everywhere.

JASMINE
(to self)
What the fuck...

Jasmine pulls out her phone and snaps photos of the scene while wakling toward it, and she texts the photos to someone.

A NEIGHBOR (50s) walks over--

NEIGHBOR
Hey, is she home?

JASMINE
No, she’s out of town.

NEIGHBOR
What the fuck’s going on?

JASMINE
I dunno, I’m dealing with it. Sorry for the trouble.

INT. GRACIELA’S HOUSE
Jasmine enters, and the high schoolers look at her warily. Jasmine finds Jaime--

JASMINE
‘Scuse me, you gotta turn the music off.

JAIME
Huh?

JASMINE
Music is way too loud.

JAIME
You’re looking for Moriah? She’s upstairs.

Jasmine goes over and turns off the sound system.

JAIME
Hey!

JASMINE
(to everyone)
Guys, you all need to go home. Who here is sober?

Teenagers look confusedly at Jasimne. Moriah shrinks when she sees her mom.

EXT. GRACIELA’S HOUSE - NIGHT
Four high schoolers get into an Uber, Jasmine is at the driver’s side window.

JASMINE
(to Driver)
Thanks.

The Uber drives off. Just Jaime and Moriah are still here.

JASMINE
(to Jaime)
Now you clean that entire house.

JAIME
Yes ma’am.

Jaime scurries inside and Jasmine gives Moriah a disappointed look.

INT. JASMINE’S HOUSE/KITCHEN - MORNING
The next morning, Jaime pours himself a bowl of cereal, at the dining table. Jasmine sips coffee and observes him with a vacant gaze. Moriah is nearby, at a desk, doing homework.

INT. JASMINE’S HOUSE - MORNING (A LITTLE LATER)
Jasmine’s phone is pressed to her ear, she’s in a side room out of earshot of the kids.

JASMINE
You got an early flight back, right? .. Why? How long do you need me to watch him for? ... 
(lowered voice)
I can’t just hang out here all day, I--we gotta close that stupid thing with Randy and his, whatever, son-in-law. I was gonna take ‘em to lunch. ... 
(long sigh)
... Well you let me know when you get your flight booked. .. I love you.

She hangs up.

INT. JASMINE’S HOUSE - KITCHEN
Jasmine sits, facing Jaime.

JASMINE
Kay I’m gonna run out, get some food, I’ll be back. 
(to Jaime)
You stay. Moriah... she’s gonna come with me. 
(thinks)
No she’s doing homework, she’ll stay.

Jasmine gets up and leaves the house. 

Jaime listens as Jasmine’s car starts up outside and drives off. Then he gets up, grabs his napsack, and makes a move to leave.

MORIAH
You can’t do that.

He’s out the door before she can finish that sentence.

EXT. JASMINE’S HOUSE
Jaime walks down the sidewalk without a care in the world.

EXT. JASMINE’S HOUSE - DAY (20 MIN LATER)
Jasmine pulls her car to a stop and gets out, carrying a bag of food, and goes into the house. Some commotion and raised voices inside, then Jasmine bolts back out and looks down the sideawlk frantically.

INT. JASMINE’S CAR (MOVING) - DAY
Jasmien drives around looking for Jaime.

INT. JASMINE’S HOUSE - EVENING
Jasmine enters the house, weary, with her phone pressed to her ear.

JASMINE
Really not more I can do besides drive around--you really want me to keep driving around looking for him?

Jasmine anxiously peeks out the window, hoping for a miracle, still looking for Jaime.

JASMINE
Well I am sorry--I guess I dropped the ball. That’s my bad. I’m gonna stay put, maybe he’ll show up here. ... Okay you do that. I’ll be here. Bye.

Jasmine hangs up, frustrated as hell, and has a little cry.

INT. UBER (MOVING) - NIGHT
GRACIELA is in the backseat, she’s strikingly beautiful in a big, powerful way. She’s texting a hundred people at once, sending emails, addicted to work.

EXT. GRACIELA’S HOUSE
The Uber pulls to a stop, Graciela gets out and goes to the house. Jaime opens the front door before she reaches it.

GRACIELA
Jesus christ. Jesus fucking christ. You’ve been here? I sent Jasmine all over fuckin’ town and you’ve been here?!

JAIME
I--

GRACIELA
--*No* don’t you fuckin’ say a word. I don’t know what you think you’re doing. You wanna be on a plane to Chicago? I’ll make that happen tonight. If you wanna be here, you stop pulling shit like that. You under-fucking-stand me?

She cools off for a second, composes herself.


GRACIELA
God damn it, come here.

She hugs him.

GRACIELA
You know I missed you.

JAIME
I know.

GRACIELA
I love you.

JAIME
I love you too.

INT. OFFICE/CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
Jasmine sits with two INVESTORS (white men with silver hair); everyone is twiddling their thumbs and checking their watches.

JASMINE
I’m just gonna ping her. I think she’s on her way...

Jasmine pulls out her phone and calls Graciela--but then everyone sees Graciela come bounding from the elevator toward the glass doors. She swings the doors open.

GRACIELA
Yeah--unfortunately I’m gonna have to reschedule. How does tomorrow work for you guys?

INVESTOR
(guffaws)
Are you serious? You can’t do that. We’re pulling the plug on this, you can’t just rope us along.

GRACIELA
Well look we’re so excited to hear your pitch. Seriously. We’re gonna make it happen tomorrow, I promise. You guys just book yourselves a second night.

INVESTOR
(to colleague)
You believe this?

GRACIELA
We’ll call you with a time.

The investors get up in a huff. Graciela shuffles them out the doors and they make their ways to the elevator. Graciela shuts the glass doors, it’s just herself and Jasmine in this office now.

JASMINE
Sorry--just catching up here, we’re being rude why?

GRACIELA
Please. That’s how these guys work, just trust me. No but I wanted to talk to you about Jaime.

JASMINE
Uh-huh.

GRACIELA
Look, I’m really sorry all of that fell on you, that was absolutely unfair.

JASMINE
Thank you.

GRACIELA
And I just want to apologize. ... Maybe we can go out, you wanna go out to dinner tonight?

JASMINE
Sure, dinner, yeah.

GRACIELA
You know ‘cause it’s been so crazy, we haven’t been together much.

JASMINE
I know, it’s just meeting after meeting, or you’re on the road.

GRACIELA
Yeah I just miss you.

JASMINE
I miss you too. What about Jaime?

GRACIELA
What about him?

JASMINE
Do you have someone taking care of him?

GRACIELA
(catching herself)
Right. I was gonna get someone to do that.

JASMINE
... Do you want some help with that?

GRACIELA
Would love it. Thank you.

JASMINE
Okay.

EXT. GRACIELA’S HOUSE - EVENING
ALLEN knocks on the door. He’s tall, handsome, in his late 40s, well coiffed. 

Garrett answers the door. Both Allen and Garrett are totally caught off guard.

GARRETT
Hi.

ALLEN
Pfft, wow. Hello.

Allen laughs uncomfortably and gives Garrett a stiff hug.

ALLEN
My god, what’re you, uh, what’re you doing here? It’s been a long time, hi.

GARRETT
Yeah it has.

ALLEN
(weighty pause)
Well I’m just, I’m here to get Jaime. Why’re you here?

GARRETT
I’m actually just watching him because Jasmine and Graciela went out, so...

ALLEN
Oh, a date night?

GARRETT
I guess.

ALLEN
So you’re the... I mean yeah, makes sense.

GARRETT
No I’m not, like, his babysitter--

ALLEN
--Right, becuase he’s not even staying here. He’s going back home with me.

Garrett ponders that for a beat.

ALLEN
Anyway, you mind if I come in and just have a conversation with him?

GARRETT
Sure, he’s in his room.

ALLEN
Okay.

Allen steps inside the house.

INT. GRACIELA’S HOUSE
Allen doesn’t know his way around, but he confidently navigates upstairs to Jaime’s room nonetheless.

He points to a bedroom door.

ALLEN
(to Garrett)
This his room?

GARRETT
Uh-huh.

Allen knocks.

ALLEN
Hey buddy. Can I come in?

After a pause, Allen eyes Garrett skeptically.

INT. GRACIELA’S HOUSE/JAIME’S ROOM
Allen opens the door, there is no-one here.

ALLEN
(turns back to Garrett)
Where the hell is he?

GARRETT
I dunno, he was there.

ALLEN
Jesus christ, man, you gotta keep an eye on him, really. This kid... God fuckin’ damnit--
(shouts out)
Jaime! You in the house?
(after no response)
Come on, we’re gonna drive around looking for my kid.

INT. GARRETT’S CAR (MOVING) - EVENING
Garrett drives, Allen has his nose pressed to the glass looking for Jaime.

GARRETT
I really thought he was done with all that stuff--no-one told me to keep *that* close an eye on him.

ALLEN
(looks at Garrett)
You know he up and drove across the country on wednesday instead of going to school, didn’t you know that?

GARRETT
I’m just catching up here, I’m sorry. I was nice enough to keep an eye on him for the night.

INT. RESTAURANT - EVENING
It’s not super busy in here, and Moriah’s BOSS is discreetly chewing her out. He’s a real angry guy with a passion for demeaning his high school employees. Jaime walks up to the restaurant, enters, curious about what he sees.

BOSS
How many fuckin’ times you wanna have this conversation? You like customers coming back, complaining every single time? That’s what’s gonna keep happening.

JAIME
Hey man.

BOSS
(not noticing Jaime)
Feel like I’m talking to a fuckin’ wall here.

JAIME
Hey!

BOSS
(suddenly polite)
Can I help you, sir?

JAIME
Yeah, please leave her alone.

BOSS
What’s that?

JAIME
You’re being nasty to her. Why’re you doing that?

BOSS
No we’re good, thank you.

JAIME
No you’re not good, you’re not good at all, please apologize.

BOSS
It’s all good, thank you sir.

JAIME
No, please apologize to her right now.

BOSS
I’m gonna need you to get out, unless you wanna order something, okay?

Customers start to take notice. Jaime stares the boss down, then finally--

BOSS
Fine.
(to Moriah)
Sorry.
(to Jaime)
You happy?

JAIME
That’s not an apology, are you kidding?

BOSS
Alright--you can both get out of here.
(to Moriah)
It’s always something with you, I can’t keep having you cause chaos.

JAIME
Oh my god, you *really* don’t wanna apologize. Your mother must be so proud.

BOSS
(to Jaime)
Get the fuck outta here you little brat.

The Boss then shoos Moriah. Moriah sheds her apron and yanks Jaime out of the restaurant.

EXT. RESTAURANT

MORIAH
(sarcastic)
That’s fuckin’ incredible, thank you so much.

JAIME
Guy’s a piece of workk.

MORIAH
Yeah. But I’m fired now, so I dunno.

JAIME
You can’t let people talk to you like that.

MORIAH
Got it. Thank you. 

JAIME
And they barely even paid you, right? You wanna do something fun?

MORIAH
Does it involve getting my job back?

INT. JAIME’S CAR (MOVING) - EVENING
Jaime drives, he pulls out a crumpled plastic bag from under his seat. He opens it up, it’s mushrooms.

MORIAH
No. What?

JAIME
You ever eaten mushrooms?

MORIAH
Not scary lookin’ ones like that.

JAIME
No, they’re fine.

Jaime eats a small one.

MORIAH
Damn, you really just go for it? They taste nasty.

JAIME
Nah, I don’t mind it.

MORIAH
That’s fucked up.

He takes out another mushroom and stuffs it into his mouth.

MORIAH
Yo, you need to chill on that. You’re driving.

JAIME
Okay, I’ll stop if you eat one.

MORIAH
Oh my god.

Moriah holds her nose and eats a mushroom, quickly, with a grossed-out look on her face. 

They both look at each other, and Jaime smiles slyly.

EXT. SIDEWALK - SUNSET
Moriah and Jaime walk slowly and observe everythnig so intensely, the CAMERA is bobbing along with them freely, fluidly, like an orb, They clasp each other’s hands and dance a little.

INT. GRACIELA’S CAR (MOVING) - NIGHT
Graciela and Jasmine are dressed nicely, but they’re frantically looking out the car window, keeping their eyes peeled. 

EXT. SIDEWALK - NIGHT
Moriah and Jaime are sitting, facing each other, brimming with truth-energy.

MORIAH
I dunno if we should hang out anymore.

JAIME
I feel like we know each other so well, we don’t even need to.

MORIAH
Yeah this maybe should be the last time.

JAIME
Can I kiss you?

MORIAH
No, no way.

JAIME
So that last time I came here, in the summer, that was the one and only time?

MORIAH
Definitely.

Jaime nods.

MORIAH
(calmly)
My mom’s here.

INT. GRACIELA’S CAR (MOVING)
They chance upon Moriah and Jaime.

JASMINE
Wait--stop! They’re right there!

Graciela screeches to a stop.

EXT. SIDEWALK
Jasmine tumbles out of the car and marches over toward Moriah.

INT. GRACIELA’S HOUSE - NIGHT
Garrett and Allen sit around the dining table, uncomfortably silent. 

GARRETT
So how’re your parents?

ALLEN
They’re hangin’ in there.

GARRETT
They still in their house?

ALLEN
Yeah. Trying to remodel so they can just have everything they need downstairs.

GARRETT
Cool.

The door swings open and in walks Graciela, with Jaime. She sees Allen, he sees her, she shakes her head condescendingly at him.

GRACIELA
(to Jaime)
Go!

Jaime trudges upstairs. Graciela struts over to the dining table, defending her turf.

GRACIELA
(to Allen)
So what’s up? Whaddyou want?

GARRETT
I should probably go--

ALLEN
Seems like he’s doing *great* here, I guess I’ll just go home.

Garrett slinks past Graciela, heading for the door.

GRACIELA
You don’t think he should get to be where he wants to be? He drove here. He didn’t have to do that. You don’t think that tells you something?

ALLEN
He barely knows you, don’t act like he’s choosing you or some shit.

Garrett quietly leaves the house.

ALLEN
Look, the flight is at 10 A.M., I’d appreciate you helping us get there.

GRACIELA
No. I’m taking him to school, you get to the airport however you need to.

ALLEN
That’s funny, you taking him to school, that’s--
(laughs)
That’s really good.

GRACIELA
What, ‘cause I don’t let him hang out and do whatever he wants?

ALLEN
I heard he threw a party here. That seems like you’re watching him real good.

GRACIELA
Look, you can go ask him to come to Chicago with you. Go ahead.

ALLEN
He’s coming with me, that’s final. He’s got his whole life there, he’s got friends, he’s not staying.

GRACIELA
You don’t wanna maybe hear him out on why he’s here?

ALLEN
You’re so full of shit. You don’t care what he wants, you’re just trying to fuck with me. And let’s get one thing straight, unless it’s Bring Your Kid to Work Day for the next year, he’s not even gonna see you! Why would you care if he’s here?

GRACIELA
This is the guy who let his son drive halfway cross the country. 

Allen clicks his tongue, oozing contempt. 

GRACIELA
If you can get him to the airport, get him to wanna go to Chicago with you, more power to ya. But, you think he’s gonna be cool with leaving his car here? Did you think that through?

ALLEN
(frustrated as hell)
Fuck you.

Allen storms out of the house.

INT. JASMINE’S HOUSE - NIGHT
Moriah sits at the dining table, Jasmine paces a little, collecting her thoughts.

JASMINE
Alright, I know you probably have a lot of fun when you hang out with Jaime, but I really can’t have you hanging out with him. I didn’t even wanna bring this up, but he’s been to juvy a couple times. He’s been into some really bad stuff.

MORIAH
Yeah I know about all that. You’re always telling me to make my own decisions and listen to myself, but when it comes down to it you just swoop in and... it’s like you don’t think I can really handle myself.

JASMINE
I’m sorry. That’s not my intention.

MORIAH
And he and I took mushrooms earlier tonight, I feel like I need to go be creative and write and stuff like that.

JASMINE
Oh Jesus help me. You cannot take drugs with that kid. Do you hear me? Nothing! Don’t take nothing he gives you!

MORIAH
(blown away)
You’re right. I’m gonna be more careful, but you also need to calm down. Like I can see your fear coming out of your mouth like smoke when you talk, it’s crazy--

JASMINE
Go upstairs, go to sleep, get outta here.

MORIAH
Yep.

Moriah gets up and goes upstairs.

EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - MORNING
HIGH SCHOOLERS are everywhere, exiting their parents’ cars, dragging themselves toward the school.

Jaime gets out of Graciela’s car, starts walking, then spots Moriah doing the same.

INT. HIGH SCHOOL - MORNING
Once inside, Jaime catches up to Moriah.

MORIAH
You know my mom thinks you’re a bad influence.

JAIME
Oh she really said that? I’ve always wanted to be a bad influence on someone.

MORIAH
Well she doesn’t want me to hang out with you.

JAIME
Well. We did talk about that, right? When we were trippin’.

They walk past Cameron, who is standing at his locker with a few FRIENDS. Cameron notices them and tries to flag down Moriah.

CAMERON
Moriah! Yo!

JAIME
(points to Cameron)
There he is! Thanks for coming to the party, man! You have a good time?

CAMERON
Yeah it was great. Is she okay--?

JAIME
--Alright buddy!

Moriah and Jaime just keep walking, ignoring him.

INT. HIGH SCHOOL - DAY (LATER)
Allen is standing near a classroom door, pacing around. A BELL rings, and kids start filing out of classrooms everywhere.

Once Jaime exits the classroom, Allen gets his attention.

ALLEN
Hey bud. How you doing? 

JAIME
I’m good, what’re you doing? I thought you were going home.

ALLEN
Nah I’m sticking around for a bit. Just wanna make sure you have everything you need, and...

Allen has an affable air, reserved for his son.

JAIME
Yeah. Totally, I’m just, y’know, getting used to the new school and stuff.

ALLEN
Right. And, like, all your friends back home, y’know you don’t wanna make them feel like you just left.

JAIME
I don’t really have any friends back home, dad.

ALLEN
Well you got... What about Charlie? You guys are pals.

JAIME
Nah, he’s kinda weird now. He’s like really into doing poppers. 

ALLEN
Well. You know your mom’s really busy, she’s not gonna have much time to, y’know, spend with you or...

JAIME
That’s kinda the same with you, though.

ALLEN
(reeling)
No. You kidding? It’s like, way worse with her.

JAIME
I dunno dad, I just wanna see how it feels, y’know?

ALLEN
I’m gonna be here, if you change your mind. Alright?

JAIME
What about your job?

ALLEN
(brushing that off)
Well I’m not gonna be gone *that* long.

JAIME
Alright dad. 

ALLEN
Okay. So, I’ll pick you up? After school?

JAIME
No I’m walking home.

ALLEN
No, I’m picking you up. You’re grounded.

JAIME
Fine.

INT. GARRETT’S CAR - DAY
Garrett parks his car and JEROME (late 60s, black) opens the passenger door from outside.

GARRETT
Hey hey.

JEROME
You clean your car?

GARRETT
Yeah. I clean it all the time.

JEROME
Since last time we saw you.

GARRETT
Yeah. Definitely. 

JEROME
Doesn’t seem that clean. 

GARRETT
Okay dad. How ‘bout we get in the car, stop making mom stand in the cold.

CAROLINE (late 60s, black) climbs into the passenger seat, she has a pep in her step.

CAROLINE
Hi honey!

GARRETT
Hey mom! What’s goin’ on?

CAROLINE
Oh, nothin’. Your father’s falling apart, like always.

GARRETT
Yeah? What’s wrong?

Jerome climbs into the back seat.

GARRETT
Dad, you okay?

JEROME
Yeah I’m good! I need to eat something though.

GARRETT
Well did you have breakfast?

JEROME
No I had a call with the realtor, I haven’t eaten anything.

GARRETT
You couldn’t eat something before that?

JEROME
Well it was at seven-thirty because she wanted to talk before she had to go deal with paperwork for the old place.

GARRETT
Dad you wake up at five-thirty, I don’t know how you can’t eat breakfast before a seven-thirty call.

JEROME
Well ‘cause I gotta walk the dogs and feed them.

CAROLINE
Well we’re gonna get some food at the coffee shop, that’s what we’re gonna do.

GARRETT
Yeah they have food, we’ll be fine.

JEROME
Are we getting there before Jasmine and Moriah?

GARRETT
Ehh, probably not.

JEROME
Well I don’t want ‘em waiting on us.

GARRETT
They’ll be fine, don’t worry dad.

INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY
Jasmine, Moriah, Graciela and Jaime all sit, drinking coffee.

EXT. COFFEE SHOP
Garrett leads Jerome and Caroline toward the coffee shop entrance. Jerome peers inside and spots Graciela.

JEROME
Wait what’s she doing here?

GARRETT
Huh?

JEROME
*What is that woman doing here?*

GARRETT
You mean Graciela?

JEROME
Yeah!

GARRETT
I don’t know, she’s--we’re all hanging out. Whaddyou mean?

JEROME
I don’t understand you! How do you just let her show up, after what she did?

GARRETT
Dad, no. How many times I gotta tell you? Graciela didn’t have nothing to do with me and Jasmine breaking up.

Jerome still fumes, unable to let go.

GARRETT
We’re gonna go in there, and have a nice time--can you please not say anything or...?

Jerome tries his best to take a deep breath and compose himself.

CAROLINE
That’s her kid?

GARRETT
Yeah, that’s Jaime. You guys have met him.

CAROLINE
No we haven’t.

INT. COFFEE SHOP
Garrett, Jerome and Caroline enter. Jasmine notices them immediately and stands to greet them. 

JASMINE
Well hello!

CAROLINE
Hi honey!

JASMINE
So good to see you!

Caroline gives Jasmine a big hug.

JEROME
(to Moriah)
Hey sweetie, how we doing?

MORIAH
Pretty good. How’re you?

JEROME
I’m good, I’m happy to see you.

Jerome hugs Moriah. Then Jerome and Caroline switch--Caroline hugs Morah while Jerome hugs Jasmine--

JEROME
Hi darlin’. Good to see you.

JASMINE
You too, how you been?

JEROME
Can’t complain too much.

GARRETT
Graciela, you remember my dad Jerome.

GRACIELA
Yes, how are you my friend?

JEROME
Oh, great. I’m just really happy to be seein’ you again. It’s so nice we can do this.

GRACIELA
Sure is.

JEROME
(to Jaime)
And good to meet you, sir.

JAIME
Yeah, same.

JEROME
Heard a lot about you.

Jerome shakes Jaime’s hand.

JEROME
(to everyone)
This is great, look at us.

GARRETT
Dad, you wanna look at the food menu?

JEROME
Mm.

Garrett leads Jerome to the front counter.

INT. COFFEE SHOP - 15 MINUTES LATER
Everyone has pastries and coffee in front of them.

JEROME
(to Jaime)
So. You liking it here? Whaddyou think? How you like your new school?

JAIME
It’s pretty good. It’s better than my old school. There was kids getting into fights and... someone was selling roofies at my old school.

CAROLINE
Oh my word.

JAIME
Yeah.

CAROLINE
Wow. So where did you and your dad live in Chicago?

JAIME
South Shore.

CAROLINE
Okay.

JEROME
That’s a bad neighborhood.

CAROLINE
No, it depends on where you are, most of it’s fine.

JAIME
Where we are is a little rough.

JEROME
Hm. Why is that? Why does your dad stay in that bad neighborhood?

GRACIELA
He works there, he paints cars.

JEROME
Like at a factory?

GRACIELA
No, like at an auto body shop.

+FOR THE REST OF THIS SCENE, I NEED TO MAKE GRACIELA LESS COMBATIVE, MORE SURPRISED AND SHOCKED.+

JAIME
Yeah, I think he just doesn’t make that much money and that’s why we don’t move.

JEROME
(to Graciela)
You never thought about helping them out?

GRACIELA
He doesn’t want my help.

JEROME
Just seems like if it’s about your son, you should make sure they’re comfortable.

JAIME
No it’s not that bad. 

GRACIELA
I do help with his school, he goes to a private school. I pay for that.

JEROME
Well he’s just gonna stay here if he’s more comfortable, right?
(to Jaime)
Just make sure your dad knows you appreciate him. You’re not abandoning him, you’re just doing what’s right for you.

JAIME
Yeah. Totally.

GARRETT
Dad they can figure this out. You don’t need to say your piece.

JEROME
No, I just thought y’all talked about this stuff together. Being as you’re all very innovative.

Graciela, Jasmine and Garrett all kind of roll their eyes.

JEROME
What?

GARRETT
Well some things are just between family.

JEROME
Y’all act like one big family, isn’t that how you wanna be?

GARRETT
Yeah, sure but there are still boundaries.

JEROME
Oh, where are the boundaries? I ain’t never seen y’all have any boundaries, let me tell you.

GRACIELA
Man, what’s that s’posed to mean?

JEROME
You know what it means.

He’s looking right at Graciela when he says that.

JEROME
You know exactly.

GARRETT
Okay dad calmn down.

GRACIELA
Why don’t you help me remember, though?

JEROME
Huh! Help you remember. You already broke up this family, now you want me to “help you remember”.

GARRETT
No no no, let’s cool it.

GRACIELA
Sorry, “broke up this family”? Do you know somethin’ I don’t? Or are you just makin’ stuff up?

JEROME
Don’t gimme your little innocent bullshit.

GARRETT
Hey!--

JEROME
--Please.

GARRETT
Alright maybe I should take you home dad, you’re tired?
(to Graciela)
He’s just tired.

JEROME
No I’m not tired, I need her to quit pretending she ain’t liable for what she does.

GRACIELA
Okay I think we’re just gonna take off, actually.

JASMINE
No. No you don’t have to--

GRACIELA
Jaime? Let’s go.
(to Jasmine)
I’ll text you.
(to Caroline)
So nice to see you, honey.

CAROLINE
You too. Sorry about this clown.

With that, Graciela and Jaime get up and exit the establishment.

GARRETT
That’s great, dad. Thank you so much.

JEROME
She knows what she did, that’s why she’s slinking away.

Facepalms from Garrett and Jasmine.

MORIAH
Grandpa, why do you say she broke up the family when we’re not broken up?


>*BEGIN FLASHBACK*<

INT. GARRETT’S PICKUP TRUCK (MOVING) - DAY (2009)
Garrett drives on a small-town highway. Radio playing, windows down, fishing poles in the seat beside him.

EXT. FISHING SHOP - DAY
On main street of this small town, Garrett gets out of his truck and he stands out--he’s the only black person for miles. He goes into the fly fishing shop.

INT. FISHING SHOP
Garrett looks around, goes up to the counter where a MAN (white, 50s) is reading a catalog.

GARRETT
Hey. You got flies?

MAN
Yeah, I’ll show you.

The man leads Garrett to a glass display case in a forgotten corner of the shop.

EXT. FISHING SHOP
Garrett crosses the gravel back to his truck, looks over and sees maybe the only other black person in town--

It’s Simon, but they’re strangers to each other at this point. Simon is walking out of a convenience store nearby. 

They sort of nod to each other from a distance.

EXT. RIVER - DAY
Garrett flicks the line of his fly rod into the river, he’s standing on the shore--or just barely wading into the water. Nothing but the sound of water thrashing by.

EXT. RIVER - DUSK
Garrett goes up to his parked truck, pats his pockets and can’t find his keys. He looks inside the truck, his keys and wallet and flip phone are all in there, on the dashboard. 

GARRETT
(under breath)
Fuck.

EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
Garrett walks down the two-lane highway toward a restaurant, holding his fishing rod. He stumbles in, legs weak.

INT. RESTAURANT
Garrett looks around, sees Simon of all people waiting tables. Simon goes behind the bar and enters an order ticket into the point-of-sale. Garrett goes up to him.

GARRETT
Hey. ‘Scuse me, you wouldn’t happen to have a phone I could borrow?

SIMON
Yeah, of course.

Simon takes out his cell phone, a brick of a Nokia.

GARRETT
Thank you.

Garrett rings Jasmine while Simon continues interacting with the point-of-sale.

GARRETT
Hey it’s me. I locked all my stuff in my truck, keys, wallet, phone. So I’m on someone else’s phone. ... Yeah I’m gonna try and get a locksmith. But I’ll text you when I get my phone back. Love you.

Garrett hangs up the phone and hands it to Simon.

GARRETT
You know a good locksmith?

SIMON
There’s no locksmith open this late.

Simon has a bit of a country twang.

GARRETT
Yeah. Okay.

Garrett thinks...

SIMON
I got a friend that could probably open your truck. How old is it?

GARRETT
It’s a 2004 F-150.

SIMON
Yeah he could probably open that. I’m gonna hit him up right now.

Simon starts texting.

SIMON
You want something to eat?

GARRETT
I’m fuckin’ starving, I can pay you when I get my stuff.

SIMON
(pointing to a booth)
It’s no problem, just sit.

Garrett goes and sits down at a booth.

INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT (LATER)
Garrett is staring out the window. Simon sets down a plate of chicken fried steak, mashed potatoes and green beans.

SIMON
This okay? Chicken fried steak?

GARRETT
Yeah. Thank you so much.

SIMON
You want a drink?

GARRETT
Maybe later.

The eye contact, and Garrett’s intonation, are starting to create a vibe between them. Simon is caught off guard; he doesn’t get much attention of Garrett’s sort.

SIMON
Uh, my shift ends in like forty-five minutes if you wanna show me where your car is and... y’know, my friend can meet us.

GARRETT
Sure.

Garrett takes a bite.

EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
Garrett leads Simon down the two-lane highway, Garrett is holding his fishing rod.

SIMON
That’s a nice rod, by the way.

GARRETT
I know. You fish?

SIMON
Yeah. But not fly fishing. No-one fly fishes here.

GARRETT
Yeah, couldn’t even find a fly shop. Had to go to a bait & tackle place.

SIMON
Yeah, no-one wears waders either.

GARRETT
Whatchu tryin’ to say?

SIMON
(smirking)
Nothin’.

GARRETT
Makin’ fun of my waders?

SIMON
No. They’re precious.

GARRETT
(laughs)
Man, you’re funny. You grew up here?

SIMON
Yep.

GARRETT
You ever think about moving?

SIMON
Probably sometime. Where you from?

GARRETT
New York.

SIMON
City?

GARRETT
Yeah. Brooklyn.

SIMON
Big city man.

GARRETT
You ever been?

SIMON
No. 

GARRETT
Well if your friend can’t get my truck open, I guess I’m stuck here with you.

Simon eyes Garrett. They keep walking. It’s silent except for their footsteps on asphalt.

EXT. WOODS ENTRANCE - NIGHT
Before entering the woods, Simon stops, and texts his friend.

SIMON
I’m gonna lose service when we go in there, so I gotta tell my friend where we’re at.

Garrett grabs hold of Simon’s phone, while Simon is still holding it, their hands touch. Garrett types out the text message.

GARRETT
Dayton Trialhead.

Garrett smoothly hands the phone back to Simon, and starts heading into the woods. Simon eagerly follows him.

EXT. WOODS
It’s dark. Zero light pollution, zero streetlights kind of dark. Just moonlight. Simon and Garrett would be invisible without it. They reach Garrett’s truck.

Now having stopped walking, Simon starts shivering, he’s not as prepared as Garrett for the cold. Garrett takes off his jacket and puts it on Simon--

SIMON
(teeth chattering)
No no, keep it, you don’t have to do that.

GARRETT
It’s fine.
(mocking Simon’s accent)
Them ‘taters got me stayin’ warm.

Simon musters a guffaw.

GARRETT
You good?

SIMON
Yeah, thanks.

GARRETT
Just wanna keep you warm.

Garrett starts touching Simon’s chest, Simon snaps to attention.

SIMON
My friend might pull up, like, any minute.

GARRETT
Yeah?

Garrett moves his hands down, slowly, with Simon’s nonverbal approval. Garrett drops to his knees and goes down on Simon.

The cold air. Garrett warming him up. This is what Simon wanted.

EXT. WOODS - NIGHT (LATER)
The friend, BILLY, is unlocking Garrett’s truck; Garrett and Simon are standing around casually like nothing happened. The driver’s side door pops opens, like magic.

GARRETT
You’re a fuckin’ wizard. Thanks.

BILLY
No probl’m.

SIMON
Thank you Billy.

GARRETT
(to Billy)
Let me pay you.

BILLY
Nah, you’re good. 

GARRETT
You sure?

BILLY
Positive, I’m glad I could help.

GARRETT
Okay well--

BILLY
You guys have a good night.

SIMON
Thanks bud.

Billy takes off in his own truck.

SIMON
Can I get a ride?

INT. GARRETT’S PICKUP TRUCK
Garrett starts the truck and turns on the lights.

SIMON
You still wanna get that drink?

INT. BAR - NIGHT
Garrett and Simon are warm and cozy at the bar, each nursing a whiskey.

SIMON
So listen. Not to get in your business. But you got someone back in the city, right? Who you called on the phone before?

GARRETT
Yes. But it’s not what you think. I’m not cheating on her, I’ve got autonomy.

SIMON
So she’s like a fuck-buddy?

GARRETT
No no, she’s my partner.

SIMON
So you get a hall pass for fishing trips?

GARRETT
We’re polyamorous.

SIMON
Polyamorous? That’s like, you’re not *really* into each other.

GARRETT
(chuckling)
No. You never met no-one polyamorous? In this day and age?

SIMON
Look, this town is some country shit. Ain’t nothin’ like that no-one here ever heard of.

GARRETT
What’re you doin’ out here?

SIMON
Well it’s not all bad. Y’know and my family’s here.

GARRETT
Parents?

SIMON
No, my sister. 

GARRETT
So I’m the first polyamorous person you met.

SIMON
Maybe.

GARRETT
Well it’s not just us fucking around on each other. It’s not just about sex, it’s about communication. Being honest, about what we want. Y’know what I mean?

SIMON
I may be a little too country for that. Maybe explain it to me again in the morning.

GARRETT
The morning. Presumptuous.

SIMON
I’ve been taking care of you all night. I don’t see that stopping. 

GARRETT
A sleepover’s a big deal to me.

SIMON
Cool. No sleepover, just a nightcap at my place.

Garrett shrugs.

EXT. SIMON’S HOUSE - NIGHT
Garrett and Simon walk in the darkness toward Simon’s house.

INT. SIMON’S HOUSE
Simon shushes Garrett, and they tiptoe to Simon’s room.

INT. SIMON’S HOUSE/BEDROOM
Simon closes the door behind the two of them.

GARRETT
(whispers)
You got roommates?

SIMON
No, my sister and her boyfriend. You don’t gotta whisper in here though.

Simon kisses Garrett, and starts undressing; Garrett undresses too.

SIMON
(stopping)
Wait. Are you clean?

GARRETT
You mean STDs? Yeah.

SIMON
When were you last tested?

GARRETT
Two months ago. And I’ve been with two people since then who were both tested right before.

SIMON
Only two? You sure you’re polyamorous?

GARRETT
Ha ha.

SIMON
Well I haven’t had sex in a year. And I was tested six months ago. So I’m clean.

GARRETT
You should move.
(kisses Simon)
You’re so isolated out here.

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT (LATER)
Postcoital, Simon’s head is on the pillow, Garrett is sitting up.

GARRETT
I should get going, I’m trying to wake up and go fishin’.

SIMON
You like fishin’ here?

GARRETT
Damn straight.

SIMON
Well then maybe I’ll see you again.

GARRETT
I should tell you, I have a kid. My girlfriend and I, we have a kid.

SIMON
Oh cool.

GARRETT
So I don’t just get to go on these trips that often.

SIMON
Okay so maybe, uh... it ws nice meeting you. And I hope you have a safe trip back.

GARRETT
You like living out here in the middle of nowhere?

SIMON
It’s home now.

GARRETT
You should really come to the city sometime.

SIMON
So I just show up in New York, maybe I run into you?

GARRETT
You tryin’ to ask for my phone number?

SIMON
I’d take your fuckin’ email address at this point, jesus christ.

Garrett finds a scrap of paper and a pen, and writes down his email address. He holds it up for Simon to see.

SIMON
You didn’t catch any fish earlier.

GARRETT
No I did. It’s catch-and-release.

SIMON
You don’t bring nothin’ home for your family?

GARRETT
I bring me.

Simon chuckles, Garrett smiles slyly.

GARRETT
Have a good night, Simon.

SIMON
Bye.

Garrett leaves.

INT. ART GALLERY - NIGHT
A posh crowd walks around silently observing each art piece. Jasmine and Graciela run the show, Graciela being fully in charge. Jasmine is texting on her 2nd-generation iPhone.

GRACIELA
Whatcha’ doing?

JASMINE
It’s a babysitter thing.

GRACIELA
I thought Moriah was with Garrett?

JASMINE
No he’s on a fishing trip. 

GRACIELA
Ah. Well, can we sort out this catering thing?

JASMINE
Yeah--I’m about to call, like, three companies.

GRACIELA
What happened to the one that was s’posed to be here?

JASMINE
They had a fire in their kitchen.

GRACIELA
Well that is a damn shame, but I’m not gonna let this fall apart. So you get to fix it. Show me what you can do.

JASMINE
It’s no problem.

GRACIELA
And we got a lot of other stuff to solve tonight, so...

JASMINE
I know.

GRACIELA
Start dialing.

Jasmine dials the number of a catering company as Graciela picks up a champagne flute, flashes her winning smile and hobnobs with guests.

INT. ART GALLERY - NIGHT (LATER)
The gallery is empty, save for Jasmine and Graciela who are cleaning up. There’s leftover wine, and they’re not letting it go to waste.

GRACIELA
Listen, I know I’m a little harsh, just trying to really make it come together. And it did. Mostly ‘cause of you. You really step it up.

JASMINE
Thank you.

GRACIELA
No, thank you.

JASMINE
I just like watching you work, it’s inspiring, you know exactly what you want and you make it happen, you’re brilliant.

Graciela really takes in the compliment, she feels seen.

GRACIELA
Thank you.

She laughs.

JASMINE
What?

GRACIELA
No, I just... I’ve come a long way, I used to be at every showing, not just the big ones like this. And cleaning up after. It’s like, nostalgia, but the painful early days of the business was a lotta work.

They both stop working and sip their wine, looking around the space, at the beautiful art still on the walls.

JASMINE
It’s cool. I really admire it, what you’ve done.

GRACIELA
You’re laying it on thick.

JASMINE
Praise makes you uncomfortable?

GRACIELA
You betcha.

Sips of wine. 

GRACIELA
I shouldn’t drink that much. I gotta drop by the office before I head home. You didn’t drive here, right?

JASMINE
No, I took the train.

GRACIELA
You want a ride?

JASMINE
Okay.

GRACIELA
Just as long as you’re okay with stopping by the office.

JASMINE
Sure.

INT. OFFICE - NIGHT
Jasmine stands around while Graciela goes into her corner office and digs around some papers.

GRACIELA
Just gonna photocopy this.

Graciela photocopies the papers. Jasmine comes up behind her, as Graciela drops one of the papers, Jasmine picks it up and hands it to Graciela. Some tension... Graciela keeps photocopying.

INT. GRACIELA’S CAR (MOVING) - NIGHT
Graciela drives, Jasmine sits silently beside her. Huge tension in the silence. They stop at a red light, look at each other, and start making out.

INT. GRACIELA’S APARTMENT - MORNING
Jasmine wakes up with a start, she and Graciela are tangled up in each other and the sheets. Jasmine scrambles to check the time.

INT. JASMINE + GARRETT’S APARTMENT - DAY
Jasmine enters the apartment with an exasperated look. A two-year old Moriah is here, playing with blocks. TANYA is also here.

JASMINE
Sorry. Everything okay?

TANYA
Yeah, we’re okay. I just gotta get going probably.

JASMINE
I appreciate you staying over, things went a little late, um... but I have cash for you. Did she eat?

TANYA
Yeah, she ate.

JASMINE
Good.

Jasmine digs through her purse, pulls out cash and counts it out for Tanya.

JASMINE
Thank you so much.

TANYA
Thank you.

Tanya leaves, Jasmine kneels down to Moriah.

JASMINE
Hi peach. Did you miss mama?

MORIAH
Yeah.

JASMINE
I missed you.

EXT. JASMINE + GARRETT’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Garrett parks his pickup truck and gets out, fishing rod and tackle box in hand. He walks toward the building.

INT. JASMINE + GARRETT’S APARTMENT
Garrett enters.

GARRETT
Hey hey!

Garrett sets down his stuff. Jasmine emerges from the bedroom.

JASMINE
Hey. Sorry, she’s already down.

GARRETT
That’s alright. Thanks for doing everything yourself.

JASMINE
Of course.

They kiss.

JASMINE
Hi.

GARRETT
Hi.

JASMINE
How was it?

GARRETT
It was actually interesting, something happened.

JASMINE
What?

GARRETT
I met someone.

JASMINE
Really!

Garrett takes off his jacket and boots.

GARRETT
Yeah when I called you from someone else’s phone, I had walked to this restaurant, like a mile, it was getting dark, and this guy that worked at the restartant gave me that phone to use and helped me out. And we had a little thing.

JASMINE
What’s his name?

GARRETT
Simon.

JASMINE
A local?

GARRETT
Yeah. Probably never see him again, you know? I mean, he might email me.

JASMINE
Oh you exchanged emails. Okay.

GARRETT
That’s how you know it’s legit.
(laughs)
Just some southern boy, hanging out in Vermont. I dunno how he ended up there. Only black guy in that whole town, I think. Only one I saw.

JASMINE
Huh, that’s something.

GARRETT
Think I’m gonna take a shower, real quick.

JASMINE
Yeah.

Garrett goes to take a shower, Jasmine heads into the kitchen and starts a kettle.

Jasmine brings two cups of tea to the living room, she sits down, Garrett finishes up his shower and emerges a few moments later, new clothes on and a towel around his neck.

GARRETT
Thank you.

Garrett sits, across from Jasmine--she’s on the couch.

GARRETT
How was your couple days?

JASMINE
Also interesting.

GARRETT
Hm?

JASMINE
Yeah, so, Graciela? We, uh...
(chuckles)

GARRETT
Oh damn! What!

JASMINE
So yeah, I’m just processing that.

GARRETT
How did that happen?

JASMINE
I don’t even know, this showing last night was just us, I think it’s been building up for some time, this thing between us, and it just kinda happened.

GARRETT
Kinda complicated, working together.

JASMINE
Yeah, I mean we haven’t texted or anything today, we’ll see what it’s like tomorrow when I see her.

GARRETT
Ain’t nothing gets to be simple for us.

JASMINE
(shrugs)
Yeah, we don’t need simple.

GARRETT
Would be nice for a change.

JASMINE
(after long pause)
You think all this stuff will be hard on her?

GARRETT
I think it’s better than us not doing what we want.

JASMINE
(shrugs)
Yeah, I just wonder. That’s all. I just wonder how we’re doing, with her.

CUT TO:
Garrett and Jasmine are holding each other, on the couch.

JASMINE
Would you ever want more kids?

GARRETT
‘Scuse me?

JASMINE
Not with me necessarily, just in general, hypothetically.

GARRETT
We’ve talked about that, I don’t need more.

JASMINE
That hasn’t changed?

GARRETT
Nope.

JASMINE
Hm.

They really look into each other’s eyes. And they kiss. Tender at first, then they make out and get handsy.

_They_ _make_ _love_.

Afterwards, they’re under a blanket together, still on that couch.

INT. OFFICE - MORNING
Graciela gets in the elevator, and just before the doors close, Jasmine slips into the elevator.

GRACIELA
Hello.

JASMINE
Hi.

The doors close and they start sharing a silent elevator ride together.

GRACIELA
We don’t have to worry about the other night, if you don’t...

JASMINE
Are you worried about it?

GRACIELA
Worried--I’m not worried. Just curious, about what you think.

JASMINE
Maybe we talk about this all after work. If you’re free, maybe.

GRACIELA
(eager)
Definitely. Definitely free after work.

The doors open and they enter the empty workspace.

INT. DAYCARE / HALLWAY - DAY
Garrett and Moriah enter, coming in from the frigid windy outdoors. They seem to be in the large mudroom of an old house, but the sounds of children laughing and shrieking on the other side of a door make it clear this is a daycare.

There’s another parent here, we can’t see him so well, he’s kneeling down off to the side and whispering to his son, who apprently doesn’t want to go in.

GARRETT
Okay it’s always a little hot in there, you want me to take your jacket?

MORIAH
Yeah.

GARRETT
Alright.

Garrett takes Moriah’s big puffy jacket off her.

Just then, the other parent stands up, having convinced his son to go in. They both make a move to enter. 

We see that the parent is Allen. The younger version of Allen looks much younger than that of our other characters. He and Garrett acknowledge each other with a smile and nod, and Garrett opens and holds the door for Allen.

ALLEN
Oh thanks.

Allen and his son, who we now know is Jaime, enter the daycare to join the other screaming kids. Garrett and Moriah enter after them.

INT. GARRETT’S PICKUP TRUCK (MOVING) - DAY
Garrett starts the truck, pulls away from the curb into the road, and drives slowly. He notices Allen walking down the sidewalk, and checks him out a bit.

INT. ART GALLERY - NIGHT
[[graciela and jasmine together, 3/4 behind them, while graciela complains hard. garrett joins them.]]
Another hob-nobby event, with people looking around at art, but this one is less stuffy; there are more artist types here than waspy people.

Graciela and Jasmine are standing around. They’re running the event, but right now is a calm moment.

GRACIELA
I don’t even know what to do anymore, he’s like, trying to fuck with me.

JASMINE
You think he might’ve just hit traffic?

GRACIELA
No, he doesn’t have a car. He’s not driving.

Garrett joins Jasmine and Graciela, coming back from the bathroom. He’s sipping a drink, trying to look like he belongs, wearing a slightly-too-big suit jacket.

[[70mm, facing Allen and jaime, who are coming this way. jasmine+graciela+garrett are blurry in the foreground. this shot is wide enough that, when the back-and-forth with graciela starts, we don’t have to do any shot-reverse shot.]]
Allen walks in, with Jaime, and comes over to the group. Jaime hugs Graciela.

GRACIELA
Hey bugger! You have fun on the train?

JAIME
Yes.

ALLEN
I’m so sorry. There was crazy train delays.

GRACIELA
You coulda told me, I coulda had someone go pick you up.

ALLEN
We were in the tunnel under Prospect Park, there was nothing we coulda done.

GRACIELIA
So you sticking around, or..?

ALLEN
Wasn’t planning on it.

GRACIELA
Great. Well anyway, you know Jasmine, and this is Garrett.

ALLEN
(to Garrett)
How do you do.

# 50mm, facing garrett, allen is not seen in this shot, it’s just garrett’s shot. garrett’s recognition of allen washes over his face.

They shake hands. Garrett realizes, during the handshake, that he recognizes Allen.

GARRETT
Yeah, hey, Caterpillar’s, right? [[garrett is giddy, nervous, curious.]]

ALLEN
Right! Yeah, I saw you there.

GARRETT
Um... you don’t wanna get a drink or anything do you?

ALLEN
I’d do a drink. Yeah.

GARRETT
Cool.

# Garrett OTS allen, at bar, 70mm.
Over at the drink table, Garrett and Allen stand and sip red wine.

GARRETT
So I’m just curious if, um, and sorry, this is not even my business, but--you and Graciela, you’re not...?

# Plain old reverse shot.

ALLEN
Oh no. We haven’t been together since before Jaime was born.

GARRETT
Well that’s hard, I’m sure.

ALLEN
Jaime being back and forth between my house and her house, that really sucks. But us being broken up is very good. I can’t even believe it, we get along so well now.

GARRETT
Really?

ALLEN
Just trust me. It was bad.

GARRETT
I got another intrusive question, was Jaime planned, or...?

ALLEN
(chuckles)
Yes, actually. That was the one thing we could agree on. She drives me crazy, makes me feel like a single parent half the time, but... you know what? More time with the kid.

# 50mm behind Allen, walking with him.
Allen walks back over to Graciela + Jasmine, with Garrett trailing behind.

ALLEN
(to Jaime)
Night, buddy. Gimme a hug.

Allen hugs Jaime and kisses him on the head.

ALLEN
(to Graciela)
Bye. 
(to Jasmine)
Good to see you.

JASMINE
Yeah.

Allen walks toward the exit.

GARRETT
(to Jasmine)
I’m gonna take off too.

JASMINE
Oh.

GARRETT
Love you.

JASMINE
Love you.

GARRETT
(to Graciela)
Bye.

GRACIELA
Bye.

Garrett follows after Allen.

EXT. ART GALLERY
# 50mm shot toward doors.
Garrett catches up to Allen just outside.

GARRETT
Hey you wouldn’t want a ride, would you?

ALLEN
What?

GARRETT
If you want, I could give you a ride.

ALLEN
You sure, man? I’m like, way out of the way, I live at Prospect Park South.

GARRETT
No it’s cool.

ALLEN
Damn, thank you.

Allen touches his arm to Garrett’s bicep, warmly.

INT. GARRETT’S PICKUP TRUCK (MOVING) - NIGHT
# Camera is in the backseat, looking at Garrett, 50mm. Then a reverse on Allen.

GARRETT
You ever like to get outta the city?

ALLEN
Used to. Before the little guy came along. Now I just work, take care of him, no time for nothin’. 

GARRETT
You like fishing?

ALLEN
Sure. I like fishing. 

GARRETT
You come with me sometime, I like to go upstate. Or a little further.

ALLEN
Yeah, that sounds great.

EXT. ALLEN’S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
# 40mm from sidewalk, profile, truck pulls to a stop.
Garrett pulls the pickup to a stop.

INT. GARRETT’S PICKUP TRUCK
# Allen OTS Garrett, camera is in the driver’s window.

ALLEN
Super nice of you, dropping me off. 

GARRETT
Sure.

ALLEN
Thanks, buddy.

Allen puts his hand out, Garrett slaps it. It could turn into a man-hug, but Garrett kinda holds Allen’s hand. He leans in. Allen dodges Garrett’s kiss, and hugs Garrett.

ALLEN
Alright. See ya! Have a good night.

Allen quickly gets out and goes into the building.

GARRETT
(to self)
Fuck. Jesus christ, what the fuck is wrong with you?

EXT. ALLEN’S APARTMENT BUILDING
# 40mm behind truck.
Garrett takes off.

INT. JASMINE + GARRETT’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
# nice wide 35mm shot, from windows facing front door and kitchen, maybe tracking. 
Garrett walks in, a bit mopey. Jasmine is on her laptop, on the couch. She leans back. 

JASMINE
Everything okay?

GARRETT
I dunno.

JASMINE
Hm. What happened?

Garrett waves his hands, like “I don’t wanna talk about it.”

She gestures for him to join her on the couch, and he goes and lays against her. She gently gets up, goes to the corner of the room.

# 85mm shot on sticks, slightly looking up, of jasmine pulling out the violin.
Jasmine retrieves a violin from the corner and sets it up. She sits down, starts playing _[Baby, Now That I’ve Found You by Alison Krauss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5QLod7F0Yk)_.

# 85mm shot 3/4 or straight on garrett, locked off.
Garrett closes his eyes, sinking into the music, a smile on his face.

INT. GARRETT’S PICKUP TRUCK - DAY
# 50mm shot from backseat, looking out the car toward the line of parents.
Out front of the daycare, Garrett sits in his truck, watching the parents line up outside. Finally the doors to the daycare open, so Garrett exits his truck.

EXT. DAYCARE
# handheld 50mm shot following him from behind the whole time, as he comes around his truck.
Garrett joins the other parents in line, and one-by-one kids start coming out to join their parents. Out of the corner of his eye Garrett sees Allen, coming around the corner toward the daycare. He turns, to not face him, muttering under his breath.

# 40mm, locked off, sort of a reverse--garrett is on the right of screen, bottom right, and the daycare door is top middle or top left, and allen walks into frame to be bottom left of frame or bottom middle.
Allen walks straight over to Garrett.

ALLEN
Hey buddy.

Garrett sheepishly faces him.

GARRETT
Hey.

ALLEN
You all good?

GARRETT
Sure.

ALLEN
Kay. Hey listen. I’m sorry about last night, y’know, maybe I gave you the wrong idea? Sometimes I think it’s an attention thing maybe, I don’t shut things down ‘cause I want that attention. Shitty excuse, I know. 

Garrett looks away, wishing the moment would be over. Just then, something in his eyeline grabs his attention--he’s tarnsfixed...

ALLEN
And I think I was confused, too, ‘cause I think you and Jasmine are together as far as I understand and maybe that’s just me not understanding what that means for you guys--and I would love to know. So, I dunno if you wish I would stop talking right now.

# 85mm shot of Simon, through that clear line of sight from Garrett’s perspective.

While Allen is speaking, Garrett has been completely distracted by what he’s seeing--Simon, inside the daycare, apparently an employee, helping another employee clean up the play area.

# 85mm reverse shot of garrett.

# 50mm Allen OTS Garrett.

Allen tries to look where Garrett is looking.

ALLEN
You alright, bud?

GARRETT
Sorry--

Garrett brushes past Allen and pushes his way into the daycare.

INT. DAYCARE
# 85mm shot of simon with moriah, he looks up and sees garrett, slowly recognizes him, smiles.
Garrett slows to a stop when he sees Simon interacting with Moriah, handing her her backpack/jacket, kneeling down and being nice to her. Simon looks over, sees Garrett, slowly recognizes him, and smiles.

EXT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY
# 70mm shot from outside. fly-on-the-wall.
# 85mm super-close-up of garrett’s face, and one of simon’s, still from outside.
Inside, Garrett is sitting, and Simon comes over and joins him, bringing him a pastry. They’re all smiles, glued to each other, chatting, catching up on every last thing. We look at them from outside, as a passerby would, admiring how excited about each other they seem.

INT. SIMON’S APARTMENT - DAY
# 50mm straight on simon.
Simon sits in a comfortable chair in the middle of the living room, Garrett is on his feet, getting a look at the place. 

GARRETT
It’s been three weeks you said?

SIMON
Yeah.

GARRETT
You’ve been right here and I didn’t even know it?

Simon shrugs. Garrett approaches him.

# 60mm Garrett OTS Simon, angle up.

GARRETT
That’s crazy.

Garrett leans down and kisses Simon, holding Simon’s face.

# 85mm profile of them kissing.

Garrett starts making toast.

GARRETT
You wanna go to this thing tonight? With my parents.

SIMON
Yeah, we’re going.

Simon faces Garrett, Garrett makes a face. 

SIMON
What?

GARRETT
Nothing, I feel like my dad is just on a tear. Not really looking forward to that. But he’s always better with you around.

Garrett grabs peanut butter from the pantry.

SIMON
Are we picking them up?

GARRETT
Yeah.

SIMON
Which car you wanna take?

GARRETT
Oh, which car.
(going to Simon)
That’s a fun question we get to ask now.
(hugging Simon from behind)
You wanna drive?

SIMON
I kinda do, yeah.

GARRETT
You can drive. You’re learning so good.

They kiss.

EXT. SOCCER FIELD - DAY
Soccer practice--Moriah kicks the ball around other girls, styling on them, and one girl in particular (AMANDA) is using her hands with Moriah, playing dirty. She hits Moriah. Moriah scores a goal anyway, and struts off, making bitter eye contact with Amanda.

Jasmine pulls her car into the parking lot, stops, and watches the practice field while eating a takeout salad. Moriah steals the ball from another player and runs down the field.

JASMINE
(under breath)
That’s right. Come on baby.

Amanda has the ball, and scores a goal, and then trips Moriah--Moriah lands flat on her face.

JASMINE
Hey, what the fuck!

Neither Amanda or Moriah have the ball, and Moriah clotheslines Amanda. Amanda flips a whole hundred and eighty degrees backward, legs kicking up, and after hitting the ground, Amanda clutches her face and shrieks in pain. There’s blood. The COACH blows the whistle and Amanda’s DAD rushes onto the field.

JASMINE
Oh damn.

Jasmine gets out of her car and runs onto the field.

INT. LOCKER ROOM
Amanda is leaned over the sink, gushing blood from her nose. Her Dad is here, helping, and he’s red-hot. The entire team plus the coach and Jasmine are crowded around.

DAD
Someone call an ambulance?

COACH
Yeah ambulance is on the way, Patrick. Can you just--

PATRICK
--Yeah I got it.

JASMINE
Sorry. Is there anything I can do?

PATRICK
Yeah you can keep a fuckin’ tigher leash on that kid.

JASMINE
Ah, maybe no swearing around my daughter please?

PATRICK
Lady, you can get the fuck outta my face right now.

JASMINE
Excuse me?

PATRICK
If you’re not gonna help me just get out.

JASMINE
I asked you how I could help.
You’re being rude.

PATRICK^
And I’m saying, teach your kid you can’t fuckin’ hit people in the face.

JASMINE
You serious right now? Did you not see your daughter start it?

COACH
Let’s all cool down, let’s--everyone just get outta the locker room so the paramedics can get in.

MORIAH
We’re still practicing, right coach?

JASMINE
Baby, no.

INT. JASMINE’S CAR (MOVING) - DAY

JASMINE
Baby you wanna talk about what’s going on with you?

MORIAH
What?

JASMINE
Y’know why you’re gettin’ in fights, and stuff.

MORIAH
That wasn’t a fight.

JASMINE
Okay well you’ve hit two people in the face at soccer, now.

MORIAH
Well I’m just responding to what other kids are doin’.

JASMINE
Well yeah I saw, that girl was, like, playing dirty with you. But baby, you can’t hit people.

MORIAH
Yeah but she wouldn’t shut up about you and dad. Like asking who you date, and stuff.

JASMINE
Wait, what? She knows she me and dad date other people?

MORIAH
(shrugs)
Everyone knows that.

JASMINE
Whaddyou mean, “everyone”?

MORIAH
Like everyone at shcool.

JASMINE
Oh jeez. Well why? Why do they know that?

MORIAH
Well I told everyone about that, a long time ago when I didn’t know it was a big deal.

JASMINE
Kids give you trouble about it?

Moriah nods. 

Jasmine’s eyes dart around, her mind racing.

INT. GARRETT’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
# 70mm, Jasmine is in the foreground at the dining table, rack focus to the front door. Or I suppose it could be something other than the dining table, it could be a coffee table or whatever.
Jasmine is sitting, nursing a glass of red wine, at the dining table. Noise comes from the front door, someone unlocking the door from the outside. Jasmine gets up and tries to look like she was just leaving.

The door opens and Garrett and Simon enter.

JASMINE
Hey, I was just getting outta here.

GARRETT
Oh it’s all good. Uh, Moriah?

JASMINE
(pointing down hallway)
Yeah, she’s in there, I dunno if she’s asleep, but.

GARRETT
Yeah.

JASMINE
Hey Simon.

SIMON
What’s up, honey?

Simon and Jasmine exchange a polite hug.

JASMINE
Yeah, I’m sorry to be in your space.

GARRETT
That’s all good. You want a drink?

JASMINE
(shrugs)
I dunno. Really?

GARRETT
Yeah, of course.

JASMINE
Okay.

SIMON
I’m just gonna take a shower.

GARRETT
Alright.

Simon leaves the room.

Garrett grabs a glass from the kitchen, and comes and sits to join Jasmine. Garrett pours that red wine for the both of them.

GARRETT
She earn an early night?

JASMINE
I dunno. It was a lot, y’,now? She really went for this kid. I’m glad I saw it. But makes me worry.

GARRETT
Yeah.

JASMINE
I mean, she *went* for this girl. Clocked her.

GARRETT
You wanna get her back seeing Jordana?

JASMINE
Yeah but we also just gotta really talk to her. She told me everyone at school knows that, y’know, we’re poly. 

GARRETT
Yeah I know about that.

JASMINE
Beg pardon?

GARRETT
She told me that.

JASMINE
You know kids make fun of her?

GARRETT
Yep.

JASMINE
Jesus--how am I the last to know about this stuff? What kinda mom doesn’t know that?

GARRETT
Hey, don’t beat yourself up.

JASMINE
If I don’t know that, what else do I not know?

GARRETT
I dunno baby. Just don’t blow it outta proportion. You got a little alcohol in you, you’re upset.

JASMINE
(holds up wine glass)
Barely drinkin’ here. Fuck--I’m intruding, I need to leave.

GARRETT
No you’re fine.

JASMINE
I’m getting outta here.

Jasmine gets up adamantly, putting on her coat.

GARRETT
I’mma walk you to your car.

JASMINE
Okay.

EXT. SIDEWALK - NIGHT
# 70mm, camera is in front of car but on sidewalk, watching Garrett and Jasmine walk over to the car from its back right side (camera is ON them, and panning with them as they walk, so we don’t see the car until they reach their marks).
Jasmine leads the way to her car, she unlocks it and puts her purse in the passenger seat.

GARRETT
You good?

JASMINE
Yes.

GARRETT
You don’t want a ride?

JASMINE
(facing Garrett)
Please. You gotta get back to your life.

GARRETT
Don’t be so dramatic, it’s okay.

Jasmine sighs, looking at Garrett. She hands the keys to Garrett, he goes around to the driver’s side.

INT. JASMINE’S HOUSE/BEDROOM - NIGHT
Garrett and Jasmine both enter the room, Jasmine takes off her socks.

JASMINE
I’mma pee.

Jasmine goes heads to the bathroom, Garrett makes the bed a little bit then exits the room... he comes back with a full jar of water. Sets it down.

Jasmine comes back into the room, she hugs him, she’s naked.

GARRETT
Whoa.

JASMINE
I love you.

GARRETT
I love you too.

She’s crying. Tears fall to the hardwood.

GARRETT
You alright?

JASMINE
I’m just so happy and lucky that I get to raise Moriah with you. You’re a really good person.

GARRETT
Aww. So are you, you’re a good person. 

JASMINE
I love Moriah so much, and I wish it could have been simpler, with you and me, ‘cause then Moriah would have had an easier time.

GARRETT
Yeha, but it wouldn’t’ve been right for us to stay th eway we were. We wouldn’t be happy.

She kisses him, they have a little makeout, and then they hug very affectionately.

.FLASHBACK | INT. JASMINE + GARRETT’S APARTMENT - DAY
Garrett and Jasmine hold hands at the dining table.

They play with three-year-old Moriah together.


>*BEGIN FLASHBACK*<

INT. JASMINE + GARRETT’S APARTMENT/BEDROOM - NIGHT (2010)
Garrett is on top of Jasmine, they’re in the bed attempting to make love. It’s clunky. Their movements are labored.

JASMINE
It’s fine, let’s not force it.

Garrett climbs off her.

GARRETT
Y’know it’s not about you, it’s everything going on with me right now.

JASMINE
No I understand.

Jasmine puts on her shirt.

JASMINE
I guess I’m maybe wondering... Like, if Simon being in your life has made something... different.

GARRETT
Whaddyou mean?

JASMINE
Y’know just a man in your life... are you still feeling it, when it comes to women?

GARRETT
Yes. I’m absolutely--that’s--Simon didn’t make me unattracted to women. I’m still very much the same person I was, sexually, before I met him. Like I’m saying I’m just having a bit of a time, generally; that’s just making it hard for me. In the bedroom.

JASMINE
So this is happening--I mean, I don’t mean to ask you questions about your sex life with Simon but it feels relevant... and I think it would be reassuring for me to hear that this is not just a problem you’re having with me.

CAMERA gets close up on Garrett. He can’t squirm out of this question.

GARRETT
I dunno, there’s a lot to do with, like, what time of day it happens, I’m usually tired at night like this.

JASMINE
Okay we can try tomorrow morning.

GARRETT
And stuff like, maybe we’re a little business-like these days.

JASMINE
That’s fair. We do a lot of logistical talk.

GARRETT
Which is all to say it’s nothing about you. You’re beautiful, you’re incredible.

JASMINE
Y’know if you’re scared to say it or something--I’m not saying you are--you can tell me if you’re just not feeling it anymore. That’s something that happens. And I wouldn’t hold it against you.

Garrett holds Jasmine tight.

GARRETT
I love you so much, you know there’s nothing that can ever come between that.

JASMINE
I love you so much.

They hold each other.

JASMINE
But is that what’s happening?

GARRETT
(sighs)
No.

INT. SIMON’S APARTMENT/BEDROOM - NIGHT
Postcoital, Simon and Garrett are both under the covers naked, Simon rolls over to look at Garrett.

SIMON
Ya alright?

GARRETT
Hm? Yeah.

SIMON
Was that okay?

GARRETT
No it was incredible. You kidding?

They both smile.

GARRETT
It’s not like that, with me and Jasmine right now. Sorry--I’m not tryna give you too much information.

SIMON
(shrugs)
It’s fine. I wanna know.

GARRETT
It’s just confusing, when things are so good with you...

SIMON
How long’s that been going on?

GARRETT
Do you actually wanna hear this, though? I mean we’ve never opened that door.

SIMON
If it’s on your mind, and weighing on you.

Garrett sighs heavily, giving a “here we go” look.

GARRETT
Me and Jasmine have been having this problem... building up over the time that you and I have dated.

SIMON
Okay. But just with me? This didn’t happen with other people you dated?

GARRETT
Well I never fell in love. With anyone else, except you and Jasmine. 

SIMON
And you’re still in love with her.

GARRETT
Yes. Very much. ... This is something I never thought would happen. 

Simon nods...

SIMON
Well I’m deeply unqualified to give advice, but... I would point out how much you really do, having two full-on relationships while having a kid and a job.

GARRETT
So does she.

SIMON
Well this is about how much *you* can handle, it’s not about her. You do so much, and if there’s stuff coming up that’s making it hard for you guys, I don’t think it’s anything you’re doing wrong. 

GARRETT
Yeah. Thanks you--I appreciate that... You still feel jealous of her?

SIMON
Yeah. I mean it’s not my ideal, being one of two. So there’s that feeling that she has more of a level of a right to your time or your... yeah, just the entanglement with someone else makes me wonder if there’s only so far you and I can go, only so close that we can get.

GARRETT
I love you so much. I don’t think there’s any limit, I mean I don’t want there to be. And I wanna do everything I can to make it that way.

SIMON
I love you too.

They hold each other tight.

INT. GARRETT’S PICKUP TRUCK (MOVING)
Garrett’s driving; a 3-year old Moriah is in the middle seat and Jasmine is riding shotgun.

They go over a gnarly pot hole.

JASMINE
Careful with the bumps, man.

GARRETT
Sorry, the suspension is still messed up.

JASMINE
So where’d that six hundred bucks go?

GARRETT
(beat; he glances at Jasmine)
I’m sorry, it just didn’t work, they said it was gonna work.

JASMINE
I think you need to just junk this thing.

GARRETT
Well... no, I just need to fix the suspension.

JASMINE
Okay.

Garrett glances at her.

GARRETT
Can I really just not have my truck? Is that too much?

JASMINE
If it’s safe for our daughter, that’s all I’m asking for.

GARRETT
Well those pot holes are just so dangerous, you’re right...

JASMINE
I wanna drop this.

GARRETT
How much did you spend on that turntable again? Was it not four thousand dollars? Can I not have my truck?

JASMINE
(pointing)
Careful!

Garrett slams on the brakes, barely stopping behind the car in front.

JASMINE
God damn it.

GARRETT
Please!

JASMINE
Sorry, I’m stressed.
(to Moriah)
It’s okay, baby.
(to Garrett)
Maybe check out those brakes too?

GARRETT
Let’s drop it.

Garrett and Jasmine give each other the silent treatment.

INT. JASMINE + GARRETT’S APARTMENT/BEDROOM - DAY
Moriah is playing in the next room, Jasmine and Garrett are keeping an eye on her even though their mood is intense.

GARRETT
I don’t wanna have this conversation right now. Not in front of her.

JASMINE
How ‘bout we just start with, are you *open* to the conversation? It sounds like you are.

GARRETT
Yeah we can get into it, when the time’s right.

JASMINE
It doesn’t have to be a big stressful thing, we’re not gonna be yelling at each other.

GARRETT
No of course not, but I just--
(quiet)
we’re not really gonna have this conversation in front of her. Do you want that?

JASMINE
Again, I’m not thinking it has to be some... whatever. Like a big thing.

GARRETT
Well it is a big thing. It’s a break--we’re talking about a breakup, right?

JASMINE
Yeah. But I’m just saying, like how much are we actually changing? We’re not even having sex right now.

Garrett gets up and goes to Moriah in the next room.

GARRETT
Hey baby I’m just gonna close this real quick. You keep playing.

Garrett comes back into the bedroom and closes the door.

JASMINE
She’s fine.

GARRETT
I just can’t focus if she’s right there. 

JASMINE
That’s fair. I’ll check on her in a second.
(sighs, regroups)
So anyway we’re not having sex. Which is something--we’ve never *not* had sex. And I do remember us discussing, what would happen if that happened. We didn’t say we’d break up, but we at least were gonna talk about it and figure out what it means and what would make sense moving forward. So the fact we haven’t talked about it, that’s just a communication level we don’t have right now. I mean you know I love you--

GARRETT
I love you too.

JASMINE
And we’re gonna figure this out, and be in each other’s lives forever. Y’know that’s not even a question. 
(stands up)
I gotta check on her.

Jasmine goes to the next room.

JASMINE
Hey baby you having fun?

Garrett sits with the moment, lets the information hit him, and his face is in his hands. The history, the ups and downs, they hit him.

Jasmine comes back, she offers an embrace. He digs in and cries into her stomach. 


>*END FLASHBACK*<

EXT. JASMINE’S HOUSE - DAY (2024)
An Uber pulls to a stop--Jasmine walks from the house to the car, opens the back door and Jerome steps out.

JASMINE
Hey there stranger!

JEROME
Hello. You’re the stranger. 

They hug. Caroline steps out of the car from the other side and makes her way around to Jasmine and Jerome.

JASMINE
(to Driver)
Thank you sir!
(to Caroline)
Hello pretty lady.

CAROLINE
Hello yourself.

They hug. 

JASMINE
How we doin’ today?

JEROME
Oh, I’m okay. Wishing we could’ve driven ourselves here, but--

JASMINE
--Yeah, but you don’t wanna have to deal with parking, and traffic.

JEROME
Well it’s not bad around here.

JASMINE
You really don’t like getting driven around?

JEROME
No, I get nauseous.

JASMINE
Oh that’s right, I knew that. Well we can head inside, you want something? You want water?

CAROLINE
We’ll have water.

JEROME
Nah, no water.

JASMINE
You sure?

JEROME
Yeah.

CAROLINE
I’ll have water.

JASMINE
Okay. 
(to Jerome)
You drink some of hers.

JEROME
Maybe.

INT. JASMINE’S HOUSE - DAY
Miscellaneous PEOPLE are arriving in the house--family friends, mostly--and they mingle with each other.

INT. JASMINE’S HOUSE/KITCHEN
Jasmine prepares hors d’oeuvres on plates. 

INT. JASMINE’S HOUSE
Jaime and Graciela walk in--Jaime is dressed in suit-jacket and slacks, and nice leather shoes. He slouches his shoulders, in that defiant teenager way. He immediately goes up to some random adults and starts asking them offbeat questions. Graciela looks around for Jasmine.

INT. KITCHEN
Graciela finds Jasmine.

GRACIELA
Hey babe.

JASMINE
Hi.

They kiss.

GRACIELA
You doin’ this yourself?

JASMINE
Nah, it’s fine.

GRACIELA
Hire a caterer, for fuck’s sake.

JASMINE
Really? This is like nothing.

GRACIELA
Well you can hire someone and then have more time to hang out with me--

Graciela snuggles and kisses Jasmine.

JASMINE
Right...

Graciela’s eyes dart over to the entrance of the house--

INT. JASMINE’S HOUSE
--Allen walks in. He’s dressed well: pleated pants and a light-colored thick linen shirt, and plain black shoes that aren’t clearly dress shoes or tennis shoes. He spots Jaime, smiles big and makes his way over to him.

INT. KITCHEN
Graciela guffaws and rolls her eyes at the sight of Allen.

GRACIELA
Here we go.

JASMINE
What?

GRACIELA
He’s here.

Jasmine turns to look. 

INT. JASMINE’S HOUSE
Allen makes eye contact with Jasmine and waves to her. She waves back, smiling.

Garrett, Simon and Moriah walk in. Moriah’s dressed in a flattering black skirt and jacket, and wearing pointed flats. Immediately upon walking in, the miscellaneous people and family members greet her and congratulate her. She smiles and answers questions.

Garrett and Simon, both wearing springtime formal wear, let Moriah be. They wander over toward the kitchen; Garrett greets people on his way.

INT. KITCHEN
Garrett and Simon greet Jasmine and Graciela--kisses on the cheek, etc.

Allen makes his way over to the kitchen.

ALLEN
Hey fellas.

GARRETT
Hey.

ALLEN
Jasmine.

JASMINE
Hi. Good to see you.

ALLEN
You too.
(to Graciela)
I thought you were gonna invite people. No-one out there knows who Jaime is.

GRACIELA
Well why did you invite anyone?

ALLEN
I barely even know anyone here anymore.
(to Jasmine)
Jasmine, your house is incredible. I love it.

JASMINE
Thank you, it’s a lot more than I can handle sometimes.

ALLEN
No kidding, it’s like a castle.

JASMINE
Oh, I dunno.

GRACIELA
Damn, dude, give it a rest!

ALLEN
What?

GRACIELA
She’s on my side. You’re wasting your ass-kissing.

ALLEN
Honestly have no idea what you’re talking about.

GRACIELA
Go tell these other motherfuckers your sob story. Please.

JASMINE
Can you keep the language PG?

ALLEN
What “sob story”? And yeah, stop cursing, there’s children here.

GRACIELA
Oh, like you never swear around Jaime. Right.

ALLEN
I think if we’re in Jasmine’s house, we should act like she wants.

GRACIELA
Okay, fella.

ALLEN
And even if I swear around him, at least I’m around him.

GRACIELA
Yeah? How did he turn out, with you being around him?

GARRETT
Guys you wanna do this outside?

ALLEN
Wow. I thought you were better than that. You wanna go tell him how you think he turned out? 

GRACIELA
You would do that, wouldn’t you? You’d pull him into our bullshit, because you just can’t think he would wanna come here and live with me. That’s, like, outside your reality that he would ever want that.

ALLEN
Sure. You keep tellin’ yourlsef this has somthin’ to do with you, him coming here.

JASMINE
This is so not cool, you can’t fight right now.

Pople are starting to take notice. Caroline marches over to the kitchen in disgust.

GRACIELA
Well I don’t see him comin’ back with you anytime soon, what does that say?

CAROLINE
Stop it y’all. Look at where you are. Have some self respect, your kid’s graduation party. Good lord.

ALLEN
I’m sorry ma’am.

Allen looks around, like he’s lifting his head out of water.

ALLEN
Jaime, where are you? I’m sorry. ... Where is he?

As Allen looks around for Jaime, everyone slowly does too. Allen goes into the next room.

ALLEN (O.S.)
Hey! Jaime! Where’d he go, anyone see him?

Graciela follows Allen into the next room and upstairs. 

Jasmine and Garrett look around for Moriah.

JASMINE
Baby, where you at?

GARRETT
You know where Moriah is?

JASMINE
No.

EXT. JASMINE’S HOUSE - DAY
Jasmine, Garrett, Simon, Allen and Graciela all frantically exit the house and disperse to the sidewalk, the street, the sidewalk across the street.

ALL
Jaime! Moriah!

Garrett and Simon get into Garrett’s car.

EXT. SIDEWALK - DAY
Jaime and Moriah walk; Moriah has ditched her shoes, Jaime’s jacket is nowhere to be seen.

JAIME
Man, are we ever gonna, like... y’know.

MORIAH
What?

JAIME
Well, like the one time we did, we were kind of a lot younger.

MORIAH
Oh, fuck you. You always pick the weirdest, randomest times to bring that up.

He gives her a look; he’s not letting it go.

MORIAH
Yeah we were very young... and I don’t wanna do that. It’s weird. We’re, like, family basically.

JAIME
Yeah. But we’re like, not actually related.

MORIAH
You’re seriously having this conversation right now--can you just not be the grossest human ever? For a second?

JAIME
No but I’m just saying. Like what would happen if our parents weren’t so fuckin’ crazy and dealing with all their shit all the time?

MORIAH
Well we probably woulda never really been in each other’s lives that much.

JAIME
But it’s like, they take all the air outta the room, and I don’t think they notice what’s going on with anyone else around them.

MORIAH
I dunno if I agree with that.

JAIME
That’s ‘cause you keep everything so simple just to make it easier on them.

MORIAH
(miffed)
Man can you not analyze me?

JAIME
Sorry.

MORIAH
I mean, your parents got a whole other situation going on, that seems like it’s really fuckin’ tough. And I don’t really hear you talk about it.

JAIME
You don’t wanna hear about that.

MORIAH
Dude. I do.

Jaime throws a skeptical look at Moriah. But her eye contact softens him, just slightly.

JAIME
Um, okay. So it’s like, kinda weird because my dad and I moved to Chicago, when I was like nine. And I just had this like, weird situation there where I was at this private school, but all these kids were kinda rich kid assholes, y’know? And my dad and I lived in like a pretty run down house, ‘cause he didn’t really wanna take money from my mom--except she paid for the school. So I was like the odd man out. And I never really made friends. Kinda at all, in Chicago.

Moriah nods.

MORIAH
Yeah... it really sucks. Sounds like she just wasn’t there for you, y’know?

JAIME
Well. It’s all good. I’m just kinda doing my own thing right now anyway, so...

MORIAH
And you’re just gonna be at NYU, pretty close to her.

JAIME
No, I’m not.

MORIAH
Whaddyou mean?

JAIME
I’m not going.

MORIAH
You’re not going where?

JAIME
NYU.

MORIAH
What school you going to?

JAIME
None.

MORIAH
Why?

JAIME
I dropped out.

MORIAH
The fuck you talking about?

JAIME
There’s like an early dropout situation where you get all the money back, so I just did that.

MORIAH
You dropped out?

JAIME
Yeah.

MORIAH
But I helped you with that essay. What’s wrong with you?

JAIME
It’s no big deal, I wasn’t gonna be there long anyway.

MORIAH
Well you coulda fuckin’ told me that before I helped you with the essay.

JAIME
Who cares about the essay? Why’re you hung up on that?

MORIAH
Bro, I took my time outta writing my own essays to help you with that, you fuckin’ dork.

JAIME
Alright well if you’re just gonna yell at me and... you’re not even happy for me for doing what I really wanna do--

MORIAH
--What are you talkin’ about? You really wanna do what?

JAIME
Just not what everyone else is doing. It’s just college, who cares.

MORIAH
Wow. You... are an actual complete  fuckin' tool. You can’t take this opportunity right in front of you to--you know it’s so fuckin’ difficult to get into a school like NYU even if you qualify in every way, but you have this financial advantage that makes it possible for you to do this and you’re just gonna throw it away.

JAIME
So if I’m such a fuckin’ loser why are you helping me?

MORIAH
Well it’s like, we’re family. So that’s what you do. You understand family? That make sense to you?

JAIME
Yeah, we’re family. Right.

MORIAH
Dawg, don’t even try to tell me some bullshit about us hooking up when we were fifteen means we’re not family.

JAIME
No, that’s not what I’m saying.

MORIAH
‘Cause if anything, we were confused, y’know?

JAIME
No actually I’m just pretty sure I love you.

Moriah stops, looks at him.

MORIAH
Okay, you love me, I love you, whatever. It’s family.

JAIME
No, not like family.

Weighty pause. Moriah searches for a response. 

JAIME
That’s like, kinda why I think I came here.

Huge pause.

MORIAH
Um... well that’s, like...

She looks at him.

JAIME
But you don’t. You don’t love me.

MORIAH
No, I’m saying, I love you like family, obviously.

JAIME
It’s okay.

MORIAH
Wait... wait--you’re not really serious though, right?

JAIME
I’m just gonna go back to my mom’s house, I think.

MORIAH
Are you okay?

JAIME
I’ll see you.

Jaime walks away, Moriah watches him.

INT. GARRETT’S CAR (MOVING) - DAY
Garrett and Simon drive around, desperately looking for the kids...

SIMON
There!

Garrett pulls over.

EXT. SIDEWALK
Jaime is stopped short on the sidewalk, Garrett and Simon get out of the car.

GARRETT
Where’s Moriah?

EXT. DIFFERENT SIDEWALK - THAT MOMENT
Graciela and Jasmine, with Allen lingering back a little, look around for the kids.

ALLEN
You feel good about yourself right now?

GRACIELA
What?

ALLEN
You said your piece, in front of everyone, you feel good?

GRACIELA
Fuck off.

JASMINE
Guys, for once in your fuckin’ lives, just give it a rest.

ALLEN
I’m just saying. We have a kid who walks out, goes and causes chaos, whatever he’s gonna do--

GRACIELA
(exploding)
--He’s fine! He’s walking around, who gives a fuck? Why are we even out here?

ALLEN
That’s not how it works, you don’t just let ‘em run around. But you wouldn’t know that, you wouldn’t know what to do--

GRACIELA
--Jesus, just shut the fuck up, or I swear to god.

ALLEN
What, you’ll stop talking to me another ten years?

GRACIELA
Oh, ‘cause you didn’t have anything to do with that, yeah? Not like we had a whole life here.

ALLEN
Man, we’re *finally* havin’ this conversation--I’ve been waiting for this. You wanna talk about me moving? Let’s go!

JASMINE
Put a fuckin’ pin in it!

GRACIELA
Can you just tell me what you expected to happen, when you fucked off halfway across the country with him?

ALLEN
I didn’t expect no contact. That’s on you. I’m not gonna let you make me the bad guy, anymore. I didn’t stand in the way of him visiting you here. 

GRACIELA
Oh, brother. That’s a joke, you didn’t want him here. 

ALLEN
That is not true. That is just not fuckin’ true.

GRACIELA
Yeah, mister livin’ in a shack, in Chicago, why the fuck you think I’m out here making money if it’s not for him? I tried to buy you a house. You moron.

ALLEN
We didn’t need your money! We needed you! He needed his mom!

GRACIELA
No but *you* took him away. That’s on you. 

ALLEN
Fuck me, I can’t even respond to this shit.

GRACIELA
We were gonna do things different. You remember that? It was like, fuck the divorce, fuck the expectations, we were gonna raise our boy together. In our own way. Whatever we both bring to the table--you remember those conversations? Like, fuck whether we’re in a relationship, this is about Jaime. But then you fucked off and started doin’ your own thing.

ALLEN
No I’m not just gonna take the blame for that. You were already doin’ your own thing, seventy hour work weeks, suddenly we just never see you? When was that part of the plan?

GRACIELA
You coulda talked to me. You tell me what you need, that’s what we talked about.

ALLEN
No you’re not throwing this back on me. It’s like I’m the bad guy no matter what I do. Nothin’ I ever do is ever enough. That’s not happenin’ no more, I don’t wanna hear. I didn’t communicate, that’s my fault, but you had a lotta time to come and try to help me out. And you just didn’t. You just didn’t even try. So I was single parenting for a decade. 

GRACIELA
Hey, I didn’t mean for that to happen.

ALLEN
Well, it’s what happened. Deal with it now.

GRACIELA
We were gonna do things different--

ALLEN
--Again, not part of our plan for you just to be absent. Not part of the plan.

GRACIELA
I was gonna take care of the money... and then... 
(desperate)
you know?

Graciela stops walking, she’s spinning out mentally.

ALLEN
Then I do all the work? Like co-parenting? What planet are *you* on?

GRACIELA
(quivering)
No no no I just thought we would do things different and figure it out, you know what I’m talking about? ... 
(giving up)
Fuck!

Graciela starts crying, in a frustrated, huffy way.

ALLEN
Come on, he was gonna need his mom no matter what. Don’t... Ah, fuck. Y’now what I’m saying? Come’ere.

Allen hugs her.

Jasmine is kind of just observing, while trying to give them space.

GRACIELA
(crying)
I’m sorry. I’m really fuckin’ sorry.

ALLEN
I know ya are.

After a bit of that, Graciela looks up at him, still huffy and crying.

ALLEN
What?

GRACIELA
Aren’t you sorry too?

ALLEN
Yeah. Of course, I’m sorry.

Garrett’s car approaches, he rolls down the window. Simon is in the passenger seat, Moriah and Jaime are in the backseat.

GARRETT
Look what I found.

Jasmine sighs, shaking her head at Moriah. Jaime looks quizzically at his parents.
